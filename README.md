**Motivation: ** The basic motivation behind creating this repo was to learn file handling through git interface.

**Concepts Learnt:**
- Git
- GitHub
- Differences between above two
- Basic Linux commands required
- File interface: Local Code --> Github
- File interface: GitHub--> Local
- Branching (Creation, merge, delete, rename)
- Unstaging, Undoing commited change
- Forking & How to contribute to the open source community.

**  Note:**
- The individual files in this repo were created to practice the concepts listed above. Inside the files I've listed the commands in brief.
- The handwritten notes has some theoretical description.
- For practice I created two branches and later merged them in main (visible in commit versions)
- The interface was carried out in VS Code editor,GitBash terminal was used to execute git commands
