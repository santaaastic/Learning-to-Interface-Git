    "\n",
    "#This is a dummy file I created in my local after cloning an empty repository from github.\n",
    "#Steps done: Created a new repo in github : Learning to Interface Git\n",
    "#Cloned the repository using command : git clone \"Link of repo\"\n",
    "#I am now pretending to code everything in my local machine and shall push this as a commit in my github repository to understand how it works.\n",

    "#I will now check the status of this file in my terminal using ls -a command(Left bottom -- terminal in bash terminal only).\n",
    "#After executing ls -a, I see that the file already has .git file, if not I would have used : git init   This command converts it into git file.\n",
